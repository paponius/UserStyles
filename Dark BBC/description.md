### State
Update 24-03: Fixed back to 80% after BBC web update. I forgot BBC does change class names periodically.
Update 24-03: Just when I finished fixing the Style, after years of no changes, BBC redesigned and all was lost. Starting again. Now at 10%.

Added color presets which work nice together, try by changing Background to Dark Charcoal and Text Background to Rich Black in Options.

Site should be 100% Readable and 99% Styled.
Please report unreadable text on any page.  
Some white blocks on some extra pages are left unstyled. e.g. https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact, https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/guidance

### Configure
#### BBC logo - Blocks color
Red/White/Black  
White should have bright red letters, Red and Black should have white. This is not possible, as the SVG is one element for all three letters and the transparent part is not just letters but also the space between the blocks.

#### ADs background
It's customary to give advertizers white background. Sometimes when ADs background is styled in other color, AD text could not set its own backgroun and its text is unreadable.  
I don't use ADs, so can't tell if this happens on BBC site too. That's why there are options to change this.  
Yes, it's easy to just hide them. But I don't do that in my Styles.

### History
#### 2024-02: v1.2
Overall overhaul.  
Both .co.uk and .com home pages are styled.
