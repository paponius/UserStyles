I am using Stylus, before that Stylish, or other means to change a web style for decades.  
I have hundreds of styles now and few years back I started to share them.  

I can't just send everything I have to a store, as it would be unusable for others.  
I have to fix each to at least 90%, add sensible description, Options, ...  
and if I don't visit a target site, at least once in a while check it.  

I'd appreciate reports, as I don't visit every corner of each site I offer style for, and once I publish a style, I want it to work and be useful to others.  

I don't appreciate needy and rude users. Seeing comments like these, in this Issue report, discourages me from sharing.
