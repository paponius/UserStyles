The web page must be switched to Dark Theme.

In version 1 for w3schools.com, I did not care about the Light/Dark Mode, the UserStyle worked best when page was switched to Light Mode,
switching it Dark Mode made some elements change, sometimes creating a problem with unreadable text. This was an oversight.  
Also, I understand that some users like to switch to a Light Mode during a day and Dark Mode at night.  

There was no way out of this, so I scrapped the whole thing and replaced it with version 2.  
Now Light Mode is as in original and styled is only Dark Mode.  
w3schools web page mode does not adhere to user preference from system. It is in Light Mode, until you press the mode selector.
