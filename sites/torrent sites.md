This UserStyle does not make sites nicer or change a color theme.  
It's purpose is to highlight correct buttons and links,  
and hide links and buttons leading to fake and virus sites.  
It does also hide ADs, which are misleading and lying. e.g. For a paid VPN service, promising anonymity and protection from law authorities.
