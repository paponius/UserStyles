<!-- testing links in md files
There seems to be no way to open an md page other than the main readme.md in a view without the File tree.
To avoid reload, when just jumping anchors, use only "#anchor".

[Will reload the page but will open md without File tree and jumps to anchor OK](https://github.com/paponius/userstyles/#stylish-boycott)
There could be a slash before hash, or not: /userstyles/#stylish-boycott
[this will reload the md file and show File tree](README.md#stylish-boycott)

# UserStyles
This is a description of *Dark* and *DeAnnoy* UserStyles, which can be found [on UseStyles.world (USw)](https://userstyles.world/user/papo)


It is a collection covering dozens of web sites. UserStyles in it share common visual look, structure of Options and there is a "super" style which can be used to configure them all in one place.

*Dark* and *DeAnnoy* can be installed simultaneously and there are no visible performance setbacks.

Description: [Installing UserStyles.](https://github.com/paponius/UserStyles/wiki/Installing-UserStyles)

All changes done by these UserStyles are customizable and there are also presets.  

Description: [Options in *Dark* and *DeAnnoy*](https://github.com/paponius/UserStyles/wiki/Dark-Options)  

*Dark* Userstyle can be switched with presets to look like this:

## Dark
The main purpose is obvious. Besides of changing a web page to dark, these *Dark* UserStyles do:
- The pattern of the background is a visual aid, which helps for more speedy reading (it can be changed in Options to any color or other pattern)
- Text which is less significant, or unsignificant has different color (darker white, changeable in Options)
- Elements which belongs together are grouped by darker background.
- There is a different color for visited - read article pages
- Different color for links to specific article pages and for links to a general topic pages (which are mostly time waster, just to keep visitor re-circulated)
- Possibility to change text size, font and space between lines (extra useful on a mobile to have comfortably readable text but not have to swipe around too much)
- Different colors for specific elements of a page. e.g. topic-breadcrumbs, byline, date, lead, dek, this helps to quickly find them
- Visual separation of more-ons (another re-circulation attempt)
- Color for ADs background, so an AD will not trick a reader to think it's a part of the article content

## DeAnnoy
The purpose is to remove intruding or distracting elements and to see more text without scrolling. Specially on a mobile. Every tweak DeAnnoy does can be turned ON/OFF in Options. Not all of these are in DeAnnou UserStyles for all sites:
- Do not keep a header or toolbar sticking on a page
- Article body width
- Remove fake articles, which are actually camouflaged ADs (standard ADs are not removed on purpose by this UserStyle)
- More more-ons and sometimes ADs to bottom of article body

Many other tweaks which are specific to a visited site.
