For now, this file are notes to me or whoever would want to create a real definition

# What to specify
- format of the file, plain text/UTF/unicode?
- length of Name, Description
- use of higher ASCII characters in the Name, Namespace
- Can comments be added outside of the UserStyle block withing the same comment?
  /* HERE ==UserStyle== ... ==/UserStyle== OR HERE */
- Comments inside of the UserStyle block. Should be allowed, but probably with '#' as the first character
- now '@' is accepted/considered even when not the first character on the line, which can be inside a comment.
